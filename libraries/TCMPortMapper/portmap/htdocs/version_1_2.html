						<ul>
						  <li>fixed an issue with TCMPortMappingTransportProtocolBoth and UPNP where port mappings would increase their public port on refresh</li>
						  <li>fixed an issue with TCMPortMappingTransportProtocolBoth and UPNP where port mapping would leave their UDP part mapped</li>
						  <li>fixed a small memory leak with UPNP (32 bytes per refresh complete refresh)</li>
						  <li>improved compatibility with a bug in mDNSResponder by not continuously listening to 5350 - but only if we discovered a NAT-PMP compatible gateway. If you encounter a massive logging of mDNSResponder you now can switch Port Map off and on again to resolve this issue, until mDNSResponder is fixed by Apple.</li>
